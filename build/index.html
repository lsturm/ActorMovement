<h4 id="the-williamson-movement-technique">The Williamson Movement Technique</h4>
<p>Addresses how the imaginary world and craft of the actor comes alive in the body. Through deep exploration of breath, sensuality, dramatic movement, alignment, intimacy exercises and ensemble work, the actors engage in a process of physical awareness as to how their body functions in their art form. The actor&#39;s imagination is activated in every class using fantasy and relationship exercises thus integrating craft and physical work.</p>
<h4 id="williamson-technique">Williamson Technique</h4>
<p>Williamson Technique is a series of exercises that train the actor&#39;s ability to listen &amp; communicate with the whole body while developing a stronger awareness of their own experience &amp; the experience of being part of an ensemble. Two major aspects of the work are freedom &amp; connection.</p>
<p>Total physical freedom in the actor&#39;s behavior leads to his or her complete connection with the relationships &amp; circumstances of the imaginary world. The actor explores how experiences flow out of the body into sound and motion (behavior) using specific movement choreography and vocal exercises. During this process, the actor becomes aware of those places in their body where tension occurs and shall learn ways to promote the release of that tension thus deepening breath, enhancing vocal quality and allowing the body to move with a sense of ease and clarity.</p>
